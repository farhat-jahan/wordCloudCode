History[edit]
Genpact began in 1997 as a business unit within General Electric. Its charter was to provide business process services to GE's businesses, with the goal of enabling outstanding efficiencies. During the eight years that followed, Genpact began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses.

In January 2005, Genpact became an independent company and began to serve clients outside of GE. The company name, Genpact, is designed to convey the business impact it generates for its clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. Since then the company has grown from 32,000 employees and revenue of US$823 million, to 65,000+ employees and revenues of US$2.1 billion (2013).

Bain Capital became the firm's largest shareholder in November 2012.
